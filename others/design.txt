(short plaintext file – 2 or 3 paragraphs – explaining your design)

Firstly, as for the interface part, we need to design:
    1. A pop-up window: make player input their name.
    2. Three boards of the MasterMind game interface.
        - LeaderBoard (right): 
            lists the previous best scores and the player's name in the game.
        - ButtonBoard (below) - from left to right:
            places the sets of "Guess" buttons, a green check button,

        - GuessBoard (left): 
            divides the GuessBoard into two parts: left-side and right-side.
            a) Left-side: 
                displays the current guess and previous guesses.
            b) Right-side: the four scoring pegs of three different colors.
                black pegs: right color, right position.
                red pegs:   right color, wrong postion.
                white pegs: wrong color, in any postion.
        - AlertBoard(top layer):
            places the error gifs, lose alert dialog, win alert dialog,
                quit alert dialog and so on.
